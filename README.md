## About me
I’m Valerio (SolarisCipher), transitioning into cybersecurity with a protection-first mindset.  
Before this, I worked in roles where discipline, pressure management, and ethics matter: military service and law enforcement, plus fast-paced environments like kitchens and customer-facing sales.

In cybersecurity, I’m focused on **Blue Team / SOC fundamentals**: incident documentation, network traffic analysis, and practical automation with Python/Bash. I care a lot about clear reporting and repeatable processes, not just theory.

---

## What I’m focusing on
- Security fundamentals (networking, IAM, hardening, risk)
- Blue Team basics: log analysis, detection mindset, incident response
- Hands-on labs with clear writeups (sanitised + ethical)
- Python/Bash scripting for small security tasks
